# RerenderPeopleAdder

## this is a basic app that adds people to the screen, and keeps count of them.

## the logic will allow you to add or remove single users, but it will render the entire people area every time the array is changed. This is to get a feel for react styled components in vanilla js

## I have plans to make one last version of the people adder which is a proper pubsub version.
